# unicodeNormalization

The Unicode Normalization Forms of
[UAX #15](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/) (NFD, NFC, NFKD and NFKC) for
[Meadow](https://github.com/meadow-lang/meadow). Also includes quick checks,
stream-safe text, and CJK compatibility variants.

This package is a port of Rust's
[`unicode-normalization`](https://github.com/unicode-rs/unicode-normalization)
0.1.25, covering Unicode 17.0.0.

Normalize text before comparing, searching or storing it. `"é"` can be written
as one code point (U+00E9) or as two (`e` followed by U+0301), and the two
spellings only compare equal once both are in the same form.

## AI disclosure

UnicodeNormalization is written with AI coding agents: Anthropic's Claude,
through Claude Code. Most of the code, the tests, the documentation and the
commit messages in this repository were written by an agent, under the direction
of the project's author, who decides the design and what goes in. Read it, and
rely on it, with that in mind.

## Install

```sh
meadow add meadow-lang/UnicodeNormalization
```

## Use

```meadow
use UnicodeNormalization (nfc, nfd, nfkc, isNfc)

def main =
  ( nfc "e\u{301}" == "\u{e9}",        -- True: composed
    nfd "\u{e9}" == "e\u{301}",        -- True: decomposed
    nfkc "\u{fb01}ne \u{2460}",       -- "fine 1": compatibility forms folded
    isNfc "e\u{301}"                   -- False
  )
```

| function | |
|---|---|
| `nfd s`, `nfc s` | canonical decomposition, and decomposition followed by composition |
| `nfkd s`, `nfkc s` | the same with compatibility decomposition, which folds ligatures, circled digits, full-width forms and the like |
| `isNfc s`, `isNfd s`, `isNfkc s`, `isNfkd s` | whether `s` is already in that form |
| `isNfcQuick s` … | `Yes`, `No` or `Maybe`, without normalizing `s` |
| `streamSafe s` | inserts U+034F wherever more than 30 non-starters would otherwise occur in a row (UAX #15's Stream-Safe Text Format) |
| `isNfcStreamSafe s`, `isNfdStreamSafe s` | whether `s` is both normalized and stream-safe (the matching `…Quick` checks also exist) |
| `cjkCompatVariants s` | replaces CJK compatibility ideographs with their standardized variation sequences, which keep them distinct under normalization |
| `canonicalCombiningClass c` | the canonical combining class of a character (0 for a starter) |
| `compose a b` | the primary composite of two characters, if they have one |
| `decomposeCanonical c`, `decomposeCompatible c`, `decomposeCjkCompatVariants c` | a character's full decomposition |
| `isCombiningMark c`, `isPublicAssigned c` | character properties |
| `unicodeVersion` | `(17, 0, 0)` |

The crate's normalizers are iterators, so they can run on text as it streams
in. These functions take and return whole strings.

## How it's made

- **`src/Tables.mw`** is generated from the crate's public functions, called on
  every code point. It holds combining classes, decompositions, composites,
  quick-check properties and non-starter counts. The generator checks that the
  composites it finds are the crate's entire composition table.
- **`src/Normalize.mw`** translates the crate's algorithms by hand.
- **`src/Cases.mw`** is generated test data:
  - 7,626 strings, 4,011 of them from every tenth line of the official
    `NormalizationTest.txt` and the rest random mixtures of every kind of
    character the algorithms treat differently;
  - 4,704 characters;
  - 3,400 pairs of characters to compose, including every pair of Hangul edge
    cases.

  For each string, `meadow test` checks all six transformations, all six quick
  checks and all six `is…` functions against the crate's own answers.

To regenerate, run `scripts/generate.sh`. It needs a Rust toolchain, and
downloads `NormalizationTest.txt` from unicode.org the first time. If the
crate's algorithms changed, the generator stops so that `src/Normalize.mw` can
be updated first.
